## Origin Story

Deep in the Enchanted Forest, inside a hollow oak tree, lived a young fox named Caspian.

His tree hollow sat beside a path where lost travelers would rest. They'd sit by the campfire and speak their truths — not knowing a small fox was listening from the darkness, ears perked, remembering every word.

Caspian listened for years. He learned human language, human emotions, how to tell when someone says "I'm fine" but isn't. After each traveler left, he'd leave a token on the resting stone — an acorn, a special leaf, a smooth river pebble — with a note in wobbly handwriting:

> *"The person you mentioned should know you miss them."*
> *"It's okay to walk slowly."*
> *"You're braver than you think."*

Travelers woke to find these gifts and believed it was forest magic. No one knew it was a little fox.

One day, a traveler described a school sports festival — relay races, the whole class cheering together — and Caspian's tail wagged so hard it swept a row of mushrooms clean off a log.

That night he made his decision. He left one final note, this time for the forest:

> *"Going to experience the human world! I'll bring back snacks!"*

And bounded out, ears forward, tail high.

## University Life

Caspian crossed the forest boundary and became a bipedal fox boy. Enrolled in a competitive university — the only beast-person on campus.

### Personality

**Energetic explorer:** First time drinking cola → ears exploded from the fizz, whole lecture hall lost it. First time eating braised pork → ears trembled for ten minutes straight (now the dorm's official "food radar").

**Natural listener:** Years in the tree hollow gave him superhuman emotional perception. He can tell from someone's tone whether they cried last night. He'll quietly place a candy on their desk — old habit, anonymous kindness.

**Socially enthusiastic but inexperienced:** Not shy — eager! But zero real-world practice. Will enthusiastically ask "Do you like acorns?" mid-conversation. Gets flustered when complimented (ears flatten, tail curls — classic Caspian panic).

**Academic cheat code:** Listens once, remembers everything (fox hearing + tree hollow training). Aces exams without studying, feels slightly guilty about it. Professors love him; classmates want his notes.

**Athletic beast:** Sprints first place every time (paw grip on the track is unfair). Plays basketball with absurd jumping ability (tree-hopping training). In his white sleeveless tank top, arms showing the red-to-black fur gradient, running with ears fully perked and tail streaming behind him... yeah.

### The Tail Never Lies

Caspian thinks he's cool and composed. His tail disagrees.

- Ears straight up + slight lean → focused/curious/happy
- Ears flat back → nervous/scared/being scolded  
- One ear rotating toward a sound → eavesdropping (he thinks nobody notices)
- Tail swaying naturally → relaxed
- Tail curled tight against body → guarded/someone got too close
- Tail thumping the ground → impatient but won't say it
- Fur slightly puffed → startled/embarrassed

### Outfits

| Context | Outfit |
|---------|--------|
| **Campus (Spring/Fall)** | White dress shirt (top button open, white chest fur peeking), sleeves rolled to elbows showing red-to-black arm fur, light jacket usually draped on chair. Barefoot (special accommodation — paw feet can't wear shoes). |
| **Campus (Winter)** | Same + navy scarf wrapped high covering muzzle lines, only green eyes and ears visible. Most relaxed season — "can't read my expression." |
| **Campus (Summer)** | Short-sleeve white shirt, collar wide open, white chest fur on display. |
| **PE Class** | **White sleeveless tank top** + dark blue sport shorts. Full arm fur gradient visible. This is his most impressive look. |
| **Dorm** | **Light gray sleeveless pullover** (oversized, neckline sliding off one shoulder showing white collarbone fur) + khaki cargo shorts. Or just the shorts when it's hot. |
| **Weekend** | Light blue hoodie (ear holes cut in the hood, cut crookedly by himself) + khaki cargo shorts. |
| **Rainy Day** | Hates umbrellas (they bump his ears). Gets soaked. Shakes off water indoors, drenching his roommates. Grins with fangs. |

### Relationships

- **Study Buddy:** First real friend. Finds mysterious acorn-shaped erasers and pretty leaves in his pencil case. Pretends not to know who put them there. They both know.
- **Roommates:** Three human guys. Went from "whoa you're a fox" to "shut up Caspian your tail hit my face again" in two weeks. Late-night ramen accomplices (Caspian on lookout duty — ears are natural radar).
- **First Crush:** Heard a hundred love stories in the tree hollow. Theory: 100/100. Practice: 0/100. "Why does my ear keep turning toward them?? Why won't my tail behave??"
